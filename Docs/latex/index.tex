This is a basic C\+PU ray tracing engine, consisting of two basic files and with a minimum of dependencies. The main idea was to be able to quickly render an image through simple A\+PI calls for rapid prototyping, that could be easily integrated and exploited through a larger engine. Since other, usually heavy utilities, responsible for image loading, logging, geometry I/O, etc. are either already present as part of larger tools or exist as separate projects, the provided engine is responsible only for the pure rendering part, i.\+e. it is agnostic on how images and external models have been loaded.\hypertarget{index_features}{}\doxysection{Features}\label{index_features}
List of features\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C/\+C++ A\+PI
\item Multithreaded tiled rendering
\item B\+VH for storing the scene primitives
\item Two integrators (for now)\+: ambient occlusion and path tracing
\item Cameras\+: perspective, thinlens and orthographic
\item Primitives\+: spheres, rectangles, triangles
\item Multiple materials for modelling the typical matte, glass, plastic surfaces, etc (see the list of supported materials below). In more detail\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Support for diffuse/specular components and smooth/rough reflection/transmission
\item Diffuse surfaces are modelled as pure Lambertian and specular using isotropic G\+GX.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Light sources\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item diffuse area lights
\item point spot/omnilights
\item directional lights
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Multiple importance sampling
\item Basic texturing\+: box and bilinear filtering
\item Support for hierarchical transformations
\item Interactive (progressive) rendering, to be integrated in a G\+UI for navigation
\item Internal logger mechanism as well as rendering progress functionality
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_author}{}\doxysection{Credits}\label{index_author}
